2.0:
 - New main screen picture created. New panels added, more nice and
   realistic.
 - New panel added to show the active engines.
 - Pcx font library added
Pending:
 - It is required to implement functions to stop, restart simulation to be
   able to call program menu while simulation is running (affects to simulation
   loop and panel refresh functions)
 - Program menu not finished 
 - Rare seg fault occurs, not always, relative to GMemRead();
 - Planets move so fast relative to the background stars.
 - VisibleBody() function needs improvement (current check consists of Y>0,
   it does not consider the clipping window)
 - Planets are not sorted in order to print them. They have to be sorted by
   distance.
 - System clock, Mission time
 - Content for visor panel, engine active main flag, navigation mode
   (Manual,Computer).

1.0:
 - Main screen rearranged and background image added
 - Simulation speed is alarm signal based, no system speed based anymore.
 - Console system added (no commands implemented yet).
 - Timer system created to control automatic events.
 - Graphic files library improved to load 256 color files in RGB 555 / 565
   mode.
 - Screen mode is no longer G640x480x256 but the system tries to set 
   G640x480x32K or G640x480x64K (first available)
 - Planet representation enabled
 - Rotation & tilt angles added to planet representation
 - 3D library improved, no transformation function needed anymore. Camera
   system added instead. 
 - Shine added to planet representation 
 - Variable planet definition added depending on a constant that should be
   configurable automatically depending on system speed.
 - Star field added via star catalog file.
Pending:
 - Planets move so fast relative to the background stars.
 - VisibleBody() function needs improvement (current check consists of Y>0,
   it does not consider the clipping window)
 - Planets are not sorted in order to print them. They have to be sorted by
   distance.
 - Nice panel
 - System clock, Mission time
